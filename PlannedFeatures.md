# Planned features

Oh so you decided to look at the files. Welp, this was in the readme file, but I removed it since it is more for me to keep some track of a few things before adding them to my kanban board.

## About component

Have a link somewhere accesible (maybe in user info menu) and display a popup with basic app info, such as version, author and links (like GitHub).

## Room bar features:

- Make user info to stay in position and not scroll with the list of rooms.

- When clicked (or touched) it will draw a right panel with the chat room's info: image, room name, number of messages, and a complete list of participants.

## Chat window

- When the user is in a chat room, show above the chat input if a participant is typing.
